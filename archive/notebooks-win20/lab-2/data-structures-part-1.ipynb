    "The primary goal of the first half is to ensure that your Python installation process went smoothly, and that there are no lingering Python installation bugs floating around.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second half focuses more on using data structures to solve some interesting problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're welcome to work in groups or individually. Remember to have some fun! Make friends and maybe relax a little too. If you want to cue up any songs to the CS41 playlist, let us know or add them yourself at [this link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1pn8cUoKsLlOfX7WEEARz4?si=jKogUQTsSDmqu6RbSBGfGA)!\n",

Work through as much as you can in the time allotted, but also feel free to skip from question to question freely. Part II is intended to be extra practice, if you want to hone your Python skills even more.**\n",
