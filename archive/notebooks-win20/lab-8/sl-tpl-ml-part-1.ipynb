    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wow**. Just. Wow. This is our last lab, so I can't help but be a little sentimental. Just think about how far we've come together, folks. You've learned so much about the Python programming language by this point. You've learned about its philosophy and decisions. Hopefully, you've learned why those decisions make it such a popular, amazing language. You've hopefully also learned about Python's drawbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned how Python's core philosophy integrates into every feature of the language. We've talked about Python's data structures, functional programming in Python, object-oriented Python, error handling, decorators, iterators, generators, third-party and standard library tools. We've studied machine learning and learned about Python in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, you put all of that together to triangulate the location of a freaking unicorn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just think about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like, that's really advanced stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you took the `triangulate.py` route, you eliminated noise from data to triangulate latitude/longitude coordinates of an actual stuffed unicorn, hidden on campus. And it's not like we controlled the noise at all: the data we generated was **really** noisy. Every data point was generated with a variance of several kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you walked through the Row of Puzzles, you've used a truly dazzling array of Python language features. You wrote a decorator to inspect a strange function, you used `requests` and `numpy` to piece together *audio* files! That's freaking amazing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a pause, breathe, and pat yourself on the back.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1 of this lab, we'll start with a variation on a problem that we promised you on the first day of class: the Netflix Recommendation Algorithm. Then, we hope you'll take some time to become more familiar with the tools provided by Python's standard library. We want you to gain practice with the most common utilities of the standard library and also to be aware of the rest of the tools in case you ever need them."

    "## Netflix Recommendations\n",
    "A big part of Netflix's business strategy is being able to predict what kind of movies a user will enjoy watching, based on how they rate previous movies they've seen. This is such a big deal to the company that they offered [one million dollars as a prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) to anyone who could beat their algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put this problem in formal terms. Suppose you have a matrix, where each row represents a user and each column represents a movie, like this one:\n",
    "![A matrix with rows representing users, columns representing movies, and the entries representing a user's movie for a specific rating. This matrix contains ratings by Parth, Michael, Joy, and Unicornelius for the movies Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Unicorn Killer, Inside Out, and Frozen 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stanfordpython/python-labs/master/notebooks/lab-8/movie_matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One version of the Netflix problem (which is the one that the prize money was for) is to *complete* the matrix. You'll notice that some of the boxes above are marked with `?`. That indicates that we don't have a rating from that user for that movie. Netflix offered a million dollars to any algorithm that could predict the values of those question markes better than their algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a super interesting problem, and if you have some linear algebra background, I'd highly recommend that you read about it. I really like [Carlos Fernandez-Granda's notes on low-rank matrix completion](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/OBDA_spring16/material/low_rank_models.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to implement a different, but related algorithm. We're going to write an algorithm that, **given a new user's preferences about movies, can suggest which movies that user is likely to enjoy**.\n",

    "Let's start with an observation: In the above matrix, look at the ratings for Inside Out and Frozen 2:\n",

    "Unicornelius      5           5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that every user that rated both movies rated them pretty similarly (i.e., the values in the two columns are very close to each other). Based on that, we can conclude that Inside Out is pretty similar to Frozen 2, and if you like one movie, you'll probably like the other. Similarly, if you hate one movie, you'll probably hate the other.\n",

    "4. Perform unsupervised learning on this data set and cluster similar movies together...\n",
    "5. ...using that data, develop a Buzzfeed-style quiz where each question is of the form \"Which movie do you prefer more?\" and, based on the results of that quiz, determine one cluster of movies that the quiz-taker prefers, and recommend all of the movies from that cluster to the user."
