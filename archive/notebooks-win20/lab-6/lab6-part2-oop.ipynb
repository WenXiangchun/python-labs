As a a reminder, a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) is a mathematical object that looks like $1 + x + x^2$ or $4 - 10x + x^3$ or $-4 - 2x^{10}$. A mathematical polynomial can be evaluated at a given value of $x$. For example, if $f(x) = 1 + x + x^2$, then $f(5) = 1 + 5 + 5^2 = 1 + 5 + 25 = 31$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Construct a polynomial with a variadic list of coefficients: the zeroth argument is the coordinate of the $x^0$'s place, the first argument is the coordinate of the $x^1$'s place, and so on. For example, `f = Polynomial(1, 3, 5)` should construct a `Polynomial` representing $1 + 3x + 5x^2$.\n",
